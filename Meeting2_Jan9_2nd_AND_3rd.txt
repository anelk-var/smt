Unsupervised methods for clustering of training data (finite/infinite):
[Mixture models/K-means with varying K in batch case]
[Topic models/Dictionary learning/Matrix factorization]
[Chinese restaurant/Indian buffet]

Posterior regularization +
human in the loop correction +
active learning-
to correct for categories, representation or weights linking them.
